# Most streamed Spotify songs Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project I have performed a complete Data Exploration of the most streamed Spotify songs up to 2024. By analyzing several metrics of Spotify tracks, I aim at identifying trends, records and gain a deeper understanding of the music market's logic.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project "Spotify_Refined_Explicity_classifed.csv" was retrieved on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pragyantiwari/spotify-refined-explicity-classified-1). It contains 4600 different tracks and a total of 30 columns that provide with important information per each track, e.g. the release date, the artist, the track score, number of streams etc.

## Tools
The whole Data preprocessing and visualization has been performed by means of Python.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
The first step of this project regards the data loading and preprocessing. I performed the following taks:
1. Data loading and inspection;
2. Handling missing values;
3. Data cleaning (drop useless columns and duplicated) and formatting.
