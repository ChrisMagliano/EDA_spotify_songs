### Project Overview
In this project I have performed a complete Data Exploration of the most streamed Spotify songs up to 2024. By analyzing several metrics of Spotify tracks, I aim at identifying trends, records and gain a deeper understanding of the music market's logic.

### Data Sources
The dataset used in this project "Spotify_Refined_Explicity_classifed.csv" was retrieved on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pragyantiwari/spotify-refined-explicity-classified-1). It contains 4600 different tracks and a total of 30 columns that provide with important information per each track, e.g. the release date, the artist, the track score, number of streams etc.

### Tools
The whole data preprocessing and visualization has been performed by means of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) programming language and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) platform. It is accessible throughout the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024.ipynb" file.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
The first step of this project regards the data loading and preprocessing. I performed the following taks:
1. **Data loading and inspection**;
2. **Handling missing values**;
3. **Data cleaning** (drop useless columns and duplicated) and **formatting**.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA process consists of exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as:
- How has the number of released tracks changed over the years?
- Does a preferred release month exist?
- What are the most streamed songs and artists on Spotify? What about YouTube and TikTok?
- Do explicit songs have higher "track score" with respect to friendly ones?
- What are the main factors that affect the *track score* ?
