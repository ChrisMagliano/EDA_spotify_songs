# Most streamed Spotify songs Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project I have performed a complete Data Exploration of the most streamed Spotify songs up to 2024. By analyzing several metrics of Spotify tracks, I aim at identifying trends, records and gain a deeper understanding of the music market's logic.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was retrieved on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pragyantiwari/spotify-refined-explicity-classified-1). It contains 4600 different tracks and a total of 30 columns that provide with important information per each track, e.g. the release date, the artist, the track score, number of streams etc.
